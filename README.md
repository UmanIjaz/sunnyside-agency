## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic **HTML5**
- **CSS** custom properties
- **Flexbox** and **CSS Grid**
- **Desktop-first workflow**
- **React.js** for interactive UI
- **Styled Components** for modular styling

### What I Learned

During this project, I improved my ability to create responsive layouts and learned how to optimize images for different screen sizes. Hereâ€™s an example of a responsive component:

```js
const GalleryImage = ({ mobileSrc, desktopSrc, alt }) => {
  return (
    <picture>
      <source media="(min-width: 768px)" srcSet={desktopSrc} />
      <img src={mobileSrc} alt={alt} />
    </picture>
  );
};
```

### Future Improvements

- Enhance accessibility by improving keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- Implement **lazy loading** for images to optimize performance
- Add animations for a more engaging user experience
